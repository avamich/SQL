# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the Top 5 songs that contain the highest amount of spoken words.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, speechiness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY speechiness DESC
LIMIT 5;

#Then I determined the highest ranking artists by highest amount of tracks with popularity above 90.
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS Ranking
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) DESC;

#Finally I determined the Top 10 most danceable tracks.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10
